BEFORE THE KOBOLD KING
Aside from being its own adventure, Hollow’s Last Hope works well as a prelude to 
GameMastery Module D1: Crown of the Kobold King. GMs interested in running this 
adventure as part of Crown of the Kobold King  can remove all elements of the disease 
afflicting Falcon’s Hollow and instead use the encounters in Darkmoon Vale and in the 
ruins above the kobolds’ lair as supplementary encounters. Containing its own com -
plete adventure and extensive details on the town of Falcon’s Hollow, Nicolas Logue’s 
Crown of the Kobold King  is available now at your favorite local game store and online 
at paizo.com .

Hollow’s Last Hope
W
source of the malady to Brookman’s well, 
a small spring on the edge of town, and a 
rare fungus called blackscour. By banning 
the use of the spring, the town constabu -
lary hopes to prevent further infection, but 
such measures offer little respite to those 
already afflicted. 
 While Laurel has attempted numerous 
treatments, she has been unable to cure 
the disease. She lacks the reagents to brew 
one last unusual medicine, though all the 
necessary elements can be found within 
nearby Darkmoon Vale. Thus far, though, 
no townsfolk have dared to venture into the 
wooded reaches and secure the ingredients 
for this potential cure.
Adventure Summary
Charged by herbalist Laurel to cure the 
afflicted town, the PCs venture into Dark -
moon Vale to secure the ingredients 
required to cure Falcon’s Hollow of the 
blackscour taint. Along their path, the PCs 
encounter numerous forest denizens, hints 
of growing dangers within the woodlands, 
and the ruins of a dilapidated dwarven 
holding—the domain of a ferocious, bes -
tial master.
INTRODUCTION
Any number of events might draw the PCs 
to the small trade town of Falcon’s Hollow. 
Merchant caravans regularly travel here 
from any number of points abroad, trad -
ing for the rare darkwood that grows so 
abundantly in Darkmoon Vale, and poten -
tially bringing exotic individuals to town 
as guards or paying travelers. Alternatively, 
characters might be long-time residents 
of Falcon’s Hollow, young or adventurous 
souls seeking excitement and opportunity 
beyond the lumber mills and town’s petty 
intrigues. Local residents might already know one another as friends or relations, 
or they might encounter one another as 
they’re individually drawn to seek a cure 
for the town’s affliction (likely either in line 
at Roots and Remedies or at Laurel’s sug -
gestion of cooperation). 
 If the PCs need encouragement to 
become involved in the plot of the adven -
ture, a friend, relative, or possibly one of 
the PCs themselves might come down with 
blackscour taint. Alternatively, both herbal -
ist Laurel and Sheriff Baleson could put out 
calls for assistance, drawing on PCs’ specific 
talents, which might lead the PCs to learn 
of Laurel’s more unusual cure.
 When you’re ready to begin the adven -
ture, read or paraphrase the following to 
the players.
Perched at the edge of civilized lands, the small 
town of Falcon’s Hollow has always had to 
rely on itself to solve its problems. Meanwhile, 
the uncaring lumber barons squeeze the com -
mon folk for every last copper, deaf to their 
pleas. Now the hacking coughs of the sick are 
heard throughout town. The plague has come 
to Falcon’s Hollow and the town’s leaders can’t 
be bothered to stop it.
The Town of Falcon’s Hollow
A rough community wholly owned by the 
local Lumber Consortium, Falcon’s Hollow 
rests on the edge of Darkmoon Vale, a blunt, 
sawdust-choked stop on a winding trade 
route. Home to fewer than 1,500 humans 
and a smattering of other races, most of 
the townsfolk care only for the paltry coins 
paid for their backbreaking work and what 
simple comforts they can buy. A few, how -
ever, understand that what’s bad for one is 
bad for all, and so the community thrives on Hollow’s Last Hope  is a wilderness and 
dungeon adventure designed for four 1st-
level characters. Characters who success -
fully complete this adventure should reach 
2nd level by its conclusion. This adventure 
can be used as a prequel to the GameMas -
tery Module D1: Crown of the Kobold King.
 This module is a combination of wilder -
ness exploration through the Darkmoon 
Vale and dungeon delving in the surface 
ruins of an ancient dwarven monastery. 
Since time is a factor, Game Masters (GMs) 
should familiarize themselves with the 
rules for overland travel before beginning 
this module.
Adventure Background
In the past week, numerous residents of 
Falcon’s Hollow have fallen ill, each suf -
fering from the same hacking affliction. 
Local remedies prove as useless as prayers 
at the Church of Iomedae, goddess of valor, 
justice, and honor, and already at least 
one town elder has been claimed by the 
w heezing death.
 Fortunately for Falcon’s Hollow, a canny 
local herbalist named Laurel has traced the The small village of Falcon’s  
Hollow is a wild place. Nestled 
in the shadow of Droskar’s Crag, the 
people of Falcon’s Hollow are hearty 
and stern. Theirs is a life of hardships, 
broken only occasionally by a handful 
of festivals and the infrequent  
merchant caravan. 
 They face constant adversity from 
both the wilderness and the wiles of 
man. W olves nip at their heels and 
cutpurses ply at their pockets. It is a 
testament to their strength that they 
even manage to survive at all.

The Affliction
At the start of this adven -
ture, several dozen people 
in Falcon’s Hollow have 
contracted a fungal 
disease called blacks -
cour taint. While the 
malady is not excep -
tionally deadly, poor 
conditions and a 
general lack of sup -
plies mean that many 
of the sick—espe -
cially the elderly and 
young—face mortal 
consequences. Slowly 
deteriorating, most of 
the afflicted can hang on 
for several more days, but 
already the weakest have succumbed, with 
their number growing daily. 
 Blackscour taint is an ingested disease 
with an incubation period of 1d3 days. The 
disease deals 1d2 points of Constitution 
damage and is resisted with a DC 14 Forti -
tude save. Those who are infected develop 
a hacking cough that quickly turns bloody 
if the disease is allowed to progress.
 For the first two days from the start 
of the adventure, 1d4 townsfolk die from 
blackscour taint every day. On the third 
day, 2d4 townsfolk die, then 3d4 on the fourth day, with the death toll increasing 
an additional 1d4 every day until a total 
of forty villagers have perished. If the PCs 
have acquaintances or loved ones afflicted 
by blackscour taint (and who lack full NPC 
statistics), roll 4d10 for each noteworthy 
relation. If the PCs do not return to town 
with a cure for the disease by the time the 
death toll reaches the NPC’s number, the 
specified character dies. 
 Once forty townsfolk die from blacks -
cour taint, the malady has run its course, 
killing all those unable to 
overcome the disease on their own. If the 
PCs take up the search for a cure and fail to 
return to Falcon’s Hollow by this time, they 
are widely shunned and blamed by many 
for the deaths of their loved ones.
PART 1: AN ELUSIVE 
ANTIDOTE
Falcon’s Hollow has few clerics, and only 
Lady Cirthana (LG female cleric 2 of Iome -
dae) shows any interest in stopping the ill -
ness and she lacks the ability to cure dis -
eases. Since few townsfolk trust her, most lay their medical concerns at the feet of 
the local herbalist, a tough woman named 
Laurel (NG female human expert 3), whose 
income stems as much from her sale of 
snake oils and aphrodisiacs as from ques -
tionable cure-alls and bitter teas. As quick 
to suggest expensive remedies as she is to 
remind angry buyers that she is not, in fact, 
a physician, Laurel does her best to help 
those who come to her in need, but her tight 
income, need to survive, and pride prevent 
her from admitting failure. 
 In treating the blackscour taint, as in 
most cases, Laurel has turned to her grand -
mother’s tome of recipes, cures, and spells 
for aid. Although the book contains no 
actual magic, it holds the rooted wis -
dom of generations of Laurel’s fam -
ily, including the teachings of the 
Witch of Darkmoon Vale, Ulizmila, 
from whom Laurel’s grandmother 
learned in exchange for her sight. 
There’s one last treatment from 
the cultic appendices of the 
tome—scribed in a hand that is 
not Laurel’s grandmother’s—that 
the herbalist has yet to try, as she 
lacks three of the most impor -
tant ingredients and would 
rather do what she can for the 
sick with what she knows than 
chase a fanciful salvation.
 How the PCs come to entreat 
Laurel for aid is largely up to 
the GM. A DC 10 Knowledge 
(local) check or merely i nquiring 
with any of the families of the 
afflicted reveals that Laurel is 
aiding the families of the sick 
as best she can—although her 
proscriptions are little more 
than bed rest and a pungent black 
urdroot tea. Nearly anyone in town 
can direct the PCs to Laurel’s shop, the 
unmistakably named Roots and Remedies. 
The line stemming from Laurel’s shop 
makes a useful first-time meeting place 
for unacquainted PCs.
Roots and Remedies
Creeping ivy and full window boxes cover the 
façade of the rugged-looking, two-story shop 
bearing the faded sign “Roots and Remedies.” A

with pale, wheezing children, others seeming

MAPPING THE VALE
At some point, the PCs are going to need 
to determine where in Darkmoon Vale 
to search for the ingredients to create 
Laurel’s cure. Of greatest interest are: 
Ulizmila’s hut, the oldest tree in the vale, 
and the dwarven ruins. PCs familiar with 
the area might be able to make the fol -
lowing Knowledge checks to know where 
these sites lie. If they lack these skills, the 
PCs can question Milon Rhoddam at the 
Consortium Lumber Camp.

Hollow’s Last Hope
W
to be precipitously near tears—stretches from 
the open door. 
 Laurel’s shop has been besieged since the 
outbreak of blackscour taint, both by the 
afflicted and their families and by hypo -
chondriacs of all stripes. While she tries to 
help those with legitimate concerns as best 
she can, she has no qualms in selling the 
deluded her most expensive balms.
 Unless the PCs attempt to bypass the 
line—an act that might touch off a small, 
hacking riot—it takes nearly an hour to 
reach the door of Roots and Remedies. 
Once inside, the clutter and disrepair of the 
shop shows the recent traffic, and Laurel 
visibly overworks herself at the store’s rear, 
brewing remedies for the ill.
The smell of burnt earth and spicy incense 
chokes the air of the cramped, mud-tracked 
shop. Bunches of dried herbs hang from the 
ceiling, along with dangling pots, presses, 
alchemical apparatuses, and glassware 
of more arcane purposes. Pouches of rare 
plants, jars of colored glass, and all manner 
of dried, preserved, and jellied animal parts 
fill high shelves and tables doing double duty 
as displays and workspaces. In the shop’s 
rear, a rail-thin woman with severe-l ooking 
spectacles and hair pulled back tightly bus -
ies herself between an overpacked rack of 
herbs, a table covered in stray powders and 
measuring equipment, and a pot loudly 
b ubbling over with thick gray froth. Over 
the din of her work and without looking up, 
the woman impatiently shouts, “And what’s 
your problem?”
 The PCs are free to converse with Lau -
rel as they please and she can tell them 
anything they need to know about the 
blackscour outbreak, how many people are 
afflicted, and—especially—how it’s not her 
job to treat every cut and scabbed knee the 
daft people of Falcon’s Hollow come crying 
to her about. 
 Initially dismissive if the PCs don’t pres -
ent themselves as customers or capable 
assistants, she eventually comes around 
and tells the PCs what she knows about 
the taint. Even if the PCs seem honestly 
w illing to help, she might not even think 
to mention the untried medicine until the c haracters are about to walk out the door, 
calling them back at the last moment.
 While conversing with Laurel, she 
answers some of the most likely questions 
as follows:
 What is blackscour? “Just a fungus that’s 
not good for anything. Hard, bitter, and 
sharp, it likes the water and gets you sick if 
you drink it down. Never heard of it g rowing 
around these parts, though, until now.”
 What is blackscour taint? “It’s a sickness, 
almost like any other, but you get the mold 
growing in you. It starts eating away in your 
chest and belly and is damned determined 
to stay. Your body near turns itself inside-
out trying to hack the stuff up, but all that 
does is cuts your guts up… bad.”
 How many townsfolk have blacks -
cour taint?  “More than thirty, honestly, 
though at least three times that thinks 
they’ve got it.”
 Is there any cure?  “Not around here. I’ll 
get these folks what I can and we’ll see what 
good it does.”
 There’s another medicine?  “My grand -
mother’s book has a brew in it that says its 
good for this kind of thing. A weird concoc -
tion that sounds more like hoojoo than real 
medicine.”
 What’s in this medicine? “Some rare 
roots and concentrations, most of which I 
have here, but there’s three I don’t. Elder -
wood moss, which I’ve never heard of, but 
granny says the stuff only grows on the old -
est tree in a forest. A specially pickled root 
called rat’s tail, again, sounds like hoojoo 
to me. And seven ironbloom mushrooms, 
stunty little things that only grow in dark 
places thick with metal, a favorite among 
dwarves, or so I hear.”
 Do you know where we could find these 
ingredients? “Well, for the elderwood mold, 
there’s gotta be an oldest tree in the vale. 
Damned if I know where it is, though.
 “The rat’s tail and mushrooms are even 
longer shots. Way north, toward the moun -
tains, people say there used to live a bunch 
of dwarves. They’re not there anymore, 
but I’d bet their forges are. If you can find 
ironbloom anywhere around here, that’d be 
your best bet. 
 “As for the rat’s tail, who knows? Well. 
Actually. Ulizmila, the witch that lives deep 
in the woods might. She’s a crafty, mean 
thing that knows all sorts of strangeness. 
She might even have one. I don’t know what she might want for it, but I doubt it’d come 
cheap. My grandmother traded her sight to 
the old crone for a few pages of what she 
knew, and that was years and years back, and 
I don’t know a soul who got any nicer as they 
got older.”
 How much time do we have to get the 
ingredients?  “None! Folks are dying every 
day! All we can hope to do now is treat who 
we can and hope to save the gravedigger 
some work.”
 Can you pay us for finding these ingre -
dients?  [Outraged] “Pay you!? I’ll pay you 
in…! Well, I suppose I’m not doing all this 
for free either. If nothing else, this whole 
thing’s been good for business. How about 
this, you come back with everything I need 
to brew the medicine and I’ll cut you in: 
thirty gold each. Fair?”
 She can be bargained up to 45 gp each 
with a successful DC 15 Diplomacy check.
 Although Laurel has an idea of where 
the ingredients for her medicine might be 
found, she’s never set foot beyond the fringes 
of Darkmoon Vale and honestly has no idea 
where the locations she mentions are. If the 
PCs seem committed to s earching, she sug -
gests they head to the Consortium Lumber 
Camp to the east and look for Milon Rhod -
dam—the most experienced woodsman in 
the Lumber Consortium.

5PART 2: DARKMOON VALE
The PCs should be compelled to plot their 
own journey to and through Darkmoon 
Vale, choosing their path as they see fit. 
Unless a PC rolls high on a Knowledge 
(geography) or Knowledge (local) check, 
it’s likely they’ll need to make a stop at the 
Lumber Consortium’s main camp (see the 
Mapping the Vale sidebar).
 The entire journey, from Falcon’s Hol -
low to the lumber camp, to various forest 
locations and on to the old dwarven ruins, 
is just over 37 miles in length. Assuming 
the group moves at a speed of 30, the entire 
journey takes a little more than three days, 
plus any time spent exploring or days spent 
resting. This time increases to five days if 
the group’s speed is 20. Crossing the water 
on the return trip cuts it down to only 22 
miles but requires a treacherous swim or 
the construction of a crude raft.
 While the PCs are exploring the vale, roll 
on the following chart to generate a random 
encounter once per day.
 1. Foul Tracks: A DC 18 Spot check reveals 
a set of deep, goat-like tracks. A character 
with Track can determine that whatever 
made these depressions walks upright, and 
can easily follow them. The tracks only per -
sist for approximately 50 feet before myste -
riously disappearing.
 2. Dead Fey: The PCs happen upon a dead 
tree streaked with multicolored fairy blood. Three sprite-like creatures, known as keld 
piskies, are pinned here, their exsangui -
nated bodies turned to gnarled wood. A DC 
16 Knowledge (nature) check identifies these 
creatures, while a DC 14 Knowledge (local) 
check recalls dubious stories about fairy 
blood being used to turn lead into gold.
 3. Woodsmen:  Three inexpert and 
slightly drunk human hunters travel the 
forest, trapping rabbits and t racking larger 
game, specifically dunlied (see the Forest 
Fauna sidebar). If the PCs get lost or are 
looking for directions, these woodsmen 
can point them back to their path with 
somewhat questionable expertise.
 4. Glowmold: The undersides of several 
large rocks deep in the forest are covered in 
rare, glowing mold. A character who makes 
a DC 16 Survival check can harvest enough 
of the mold without destroying it to serve 
as a light source. Once removed from the 
rock, the mold continues to glow with the 
brightness of a torch for 3 days.
 5. Wyvern Sighting: Any character who 
makes a DC 20 Spot check notices an 
ominous shadow and looks up quickly 
enough to see a hunting blue wyvern 
soar low over the tree tops. Unless the 
PCs specifically (and especially loudly) 
attempt to attract its attention, the 
wyvern does not notice them.
 6. Kobold Shaman: Kolmokmurk was 
the former shaman of the kobolds who 
now lair beneath the dwarven mon -
astery. He was exiled after he drank a 
potion that killed him and animated 
him as a zombie. The zombie kobold 
now wanders the forest, thoughtless and 
aimless, attended by Creeper, his dutiful 
rat familiar (who now lives in his skull). 
He wears a crude wood sign bearing the 
word “shaman” in Draconic.
 7. Giant Mosquito: A giant mosquito 
(with the same stats as a stirge) crosses the 
path of the PCs and attempts to sound -
lessly attach itself to the character walking 
in the rear. The disgusting insect flees if it 
takes any damage.
 8. Hunter’s Snare: Grung Knifetongue 
(see area D) laid a number of dangerous 
traps about the woods. Along an overgrown 
deer trail, he set a camouflaged pit trap (see 
DMG,  70), covered in leaves and s upporting 
the form of a dead rabbit.
 9. Giant Moorsnake:  An ophidian preda -
tor crosses the path of the PCs (same stats as a constrictor snake). During the day, the 
moorsnake is too lethargic to attack and 
merely slithers away. At night, though, it 
might slip into camp and attempt to con -
strict a sleeping PC.
 10. Wolves: Two wolves in the service of 
Graypelt (see Part 3) patrol the far reaches 
of their master’s claimed territory. They 
viciously attack the PCs on sight, but both 
flee if either is reduced to fewer than half 
hit points, returning to the monastery to 
inform their worg master.
A: Lumber Consortium Camp
The Lumber Consortium Camp cuts an ugly scar 
of stumps into a dense stand of proud dark -
wood trees. Five sturdy-looking log buildings—
s eemingly a bunkhouse, meal hall, office, barn, 
and smithy—stand with numerous wide carts 
and sleds amid the sawdust-covered clearing.
 Owned and operated by the local Lum -
ber Consortium, the camp appears as cal -
lous and unrelenting as the men who work 
it. Visitors without direct business with the 
camp foreman are typically sent packing 
by the first band of surly loggers (CN male 
human warrior 1/expert 1) they encounter. 
If the PCs come inquiring after woods -
man Milon Rhoddam, their requests are 
ignored by the workers unless they succeed 
at a DC 16 Diplomacy or Intimidate check. 
PCs who inquire after the camp foreman, 
Jarlben Trookshavits, are taken to his filthy 
office, thickly decorated with taxidermies 
of fierce forest animals. The impatient 
foreman sends for Rhoddam if the PCs 
succeed at a DC 14 Diplomacy check or pay 
the man 5 gp.
 Milon Rhoddam (N male human expert 
2/ranger 2), a blunt, quiet man, is one of the 
most experienced wanderers and woods -
men in the region. His nephew has taken ill 
with blackscour taint and, if the PCs explain 
they’re trying to find reagents to brew a cure, 
he gladly sketches them a rough map of the 
forest, marking the location of where he 
believes Ulizmila’s hut, the oldest tree in the 
forest, and the dwarven ruins stand. Should 
more than thirty townsfolk die before the 
PCs return, Rhoddam’s young nephew is 
among the dead, and the canny tracker 
holds them responsible, possibly seeking 
revenge at a future date.

Hollow’s Last Hope
W
B. Bait (EL 1)
This encounter occurs the first time the 
characters draw near the river or lake. 
PCs passing near this area must make 
a DC 16 Listen check to hear an animal’s 
w himpering a short distance away.
Not far from the edge of the forest-shrouded 
lake, a fox with large ears and bright orange 
fur lies bleeding, its hindquarters caught fully 
in the jaws of a crude iron trap.
 Although the fox here has obviously been 
snared by a hunter’s cruel trap, the beast’s 
cries are part of a ploy meant to lure greater 
prey. The hobgoblin poacher Grung Knife -
tongue lies in wait, hoping the fox’s cries 
attract a Darkmoon wolf, one of the giant 
moorsnakes from the lake, or other curious 
passersby, like the PCs.
 The fox lies on the grassy shore of the 
lake or river, some 10 feet from the water and 20 feet from the forest. Knifetongue has 
set up his hiding spot 50 feet to the north-
east of his trap, just within the trees.
 PCs who attempt to remove the fox from 
the trap can do so by succeeding at a DC 14 
Strength check. The pitiful animal puts up 
no resistance.
  Creatures: Grung Knifetongue, a gray-
skinned hobgoblin with a prodigious 
cleft palate, lurks in the nearby tree line, 
w atching over his catch with his bow and 
waiting for greater prey.
Grung Knifetongue CR 1/2
Hobgoblin War 1
hp 6; MM 153
TACTICS
Before Combat Grung hides nearby, taking 10 
on his Hide check (for a total of 18 including 
penalties for distance). Those who fail to 
spot him are surprised when he attacks.
During Combat Grung has a shortbow instead 
of javelins and fires every round at the PCs, while his razorcrows attack.
Morale If Grung takes any amount of damage 
or if the PCs close to within 20 feet of him, 
he leaps from his perch (10 feet up in the 
trees) and attempts to flee.
Razorcrows (2) CR 1/3
hp 4; MM 273 (hawk)
TACTICS
Morale The razorcrows fight to the death.
 The fox is a Darkmoon firefoot, a spe -
cies of fennec unique to this region (see 
sidebar). The firefoot is badly injured, its 
hindquarters slashed by the hobgoblin’s 
trap. If left alone, it dies in days. A charac -
ter who saves and treats the fennec, though, 
can nurse it back to health in two weeks 
(or one week with a DC 14 Heal check). If 
the character attending to the firefoot has 
either wild empathy or succeeds at a DC 14 
Handle Animal check, the fox remains with 
the PC after it is healed.

FOREST FAUNA
A number of unusual or unique creatures dwell in the region around Falcon’s Hollow 
and in Darkmoon Vale. Listed here are but a few PCs might encounter along their trav -
els. A DC 12 Knowledge (nature) check identifies any of these creatures.
 Dunlied (Brush Colt):  A particularly stout breed of small-antlered deer, often trained 
by foresters as mounts (same stats as light horse).
 Giant Moorsnake: Gray and brown patterned aquatic snakes, skilled at hiding amid 
debris and floating foliage at the edges of rivers and lakes (same stats as constrictor 
snake).
 Firefoot Fennec: Small foxes with large ears and wispy patches of flame-colored fur 
around their paws (same stats as dog)
 Razorcrow: Over-large rooks with distinctive, jagged beaks and unkempt, oily black 
feathers (same stats as hawk).
 Saingrist’s Crawler: A breed of angry red and black centipede capable of growing to 
monstrous size (same stats as any monstrous centipede). Their bites are said to burn 
like fire.
 Slurk: Disgusting, pale subterranean frogs that secrete powerful adhesives (see D1: 
Crown of the Kobold King).
7C: The Forest Elder (EL 2)
The dense trees and thick brush of the for -
est give way, parting seemingly in respect for 
the titanic darkwood tree that dominates this 
clearing. Several times taller than a temple 
minaret, in one direction the obviously ancient 
tree reaches into the sky with branches like a 
giant’s arms, while in the other it plumbs the 
earth with roots thicker than a man’s waist. 
Its limbs broad and strong, its bark thick and 
so richly colored as to almost be black, and 
its leaves the size of bucklers, the giant thing 
is less a tree and more a cathedral of boughs 
and branches.  
 This elder darkwood tree is the most 
ancient of its kind in Darkmoon Vale. Said 
to have been carried as a sapling from the 
Hissing Jungle and planted here in the dis -
tant past by Deirzir, the Eagle of The First 
Way, himself, the druids that once guarded 
the forest claimed this darkwood to be the 
root from which all Darkmoon grew.
 The clearing is roughly ovular, 180 feet 
from north to south and 110 feet from west 
to east. The elder darkwood has a trunk 30 
feet in diameter, with low, easy to climb 
branches (DC 12 Climb check) that extend 
35 feet from the trunk in every direction. A 
persistent character could eventually scale 
the tree’s nearly 300-foot height, gaining a 
commanding view of the entire forest. Any 
character who climbs the tree may make a DC 14 Spot check to notice three bodies 
hanging in the high limbs (see treasure). 
 Despite its serene nature, the glade is not 
without danger.
 Creature:  A rare dragonkin known as a 
tatzlwyrm makes its lair in the branches of 
the massive darkwood here. 
Tatzlwyrm CR 2
hp 22; see the appendix
TACTICS
Before Combat When the PCs enter the 
glade, the tatzlwyrm is hiding amid the 
tree’s leaves and branches near its trunk. It 
should be considered to have taken 10 on 
its Hide check and, thus, PCs must make a 
DC 23 Spot check to notice the beast and 
avoid surprise.
During Combat When the PCs approach, it 
charges from the tree, using its pounce 
ability and trying to grapple its victim.
Morale If reduced to 7 or fewer hit points, the 
tatzlwyrm attempts to flee.
 Treasure: A DC 12 Search check focus -
ing on the elder darkwood’s trunk reveals 
a small patch of elderwood moss Laurel 
described. The growth is easily collected by 
even the most unskilled hand.
 Those who investigate the bodies in the 
elder darkwood find the corpses of three 
hunters who went missing from Falcon’s 
Hollow months ago, killed by the tatzl -
wrym when they happened upon the grove. 
Although the bodies have been stripped of nearly all their flesh, the woodsmen’s equip -
ment still dangles from their half-devoured 
carcasses. Those who search the bodies find 
the following items remain in useful con -
dition: two crossbows, two short swords, a 
suit of hide armor, a masterwork shortbow, 
a signet ring with the image of a flaming 
hawk (worth 5 gp), 9 gp, 12 sp, and eight days’ 
worth of rations.
D: The Hag-Haunted Hollow 
(EL 2)
The sounds of the forest become suddenly dis -
tant as the trees part, opening into a small, 
almost perfectly circular glade. The near -
est stands of pine, eyln, and darkwood—all 
typically sturdy woods—twist away from 
the cl earing, as if bent by some impossibly 
strong wind or seemingly in an attempt to flee 
despite their paralyzed roots. At the glade’s 
center squats an ugly cottage, little more than 
a pile of twigs, shoots, and ivy stacked upon 
mud walls. From the thatched roof dangle 
bundles of gnarled roots, old dried beast car -
casses, and knucklebone bangles, all clattering 
together like gruesome wind chimes. A dozen 
small thatched fetishes—each shaped like 
a tiny man, imp, or rearing serpent—stand 
propped in the yard, keeping guard before a 
rickety plank door.
 Years ago this cottage was home to the 
witch Ulizmila, a wise woman, practitio -
ner of the old ways, and local boogieman. 
While some said she was a monstrous hag 
and great, great granddaughter of Baba 
Yaga herself, the deathless Witch Queen of 
the North, others knew her as a harsh but 
wise sage willing to share her wisdom for 
strange and often morbid prices. Although 
her works still spoil in this glen, Ulizmila 
is long since gone.
 This clearing is roughly 120 feet in diam -
eter, with a dilapidated, circular, 15-foot cot -
tage at its center. Fourteen unnerving but 
harmless 3-foot-tall scarecrow-like effigies 
are propped-up throughout the glade. Any -
one who approaches the cottage can see that 
its moldering door has rotted off its hinges 
but still blocks the way within. Any charac -
ter who makes a DC 10 Strength check can 
easily heft aside the barrier.
 Inside, the cottage is dank, reeking, and 
filled with shadows. Haphazardly hung

DESCRIPTION
This grotesque, amulet-like shrunken head 
is said to contain the enslaved soul of its 
former owner. Forced to obey whomever 
carries it, once per day a soulspeaker  can 
repeat a message as if the spell magic mouth  
were cast upon it. The owner must merely 
hold the 6-inch-in-diameter head and speak 
his message and the conditions under which 
the soulspeaker should repeat it. While it 
carries a message, the eyes of the stitched 
head stretch open, closing as soon as its 
message has been delivered.

W
shelves line the walls, covered in all m anner 
of clay jugs, clouded bottles, strangely 
cut rocks, rotted bunches of herbs, and a 
museum of other crude curios and rem -
nants of a bone grinder’s artifice. A rusted 
iron cauldron, with a mouth nearly 5 feet 
wide and a depth of at least 3 feet, domi -
nates the hut’s single room, its ash-covered 
surface shaped with a relief of capering 
fiends and leering devils. Across from the 
door, against the far walls, stands a high-
backed chair made of wicker, the gigantic 
curved tusks of some monstrous beast, and 
thousands of human teeth. In the chair 
sits what looks like a corpse wrapped in 
filthy burial linens, its form padded with 
pungent herbs and sprouting patches of 
thick white mold. This ominous shape is 
actually only a bundle of branches, mud, 
and linen, left by Ulizmila to distract tres -
passers from her home’s actual guardian, 
her pet cauldron.   
 Creature:  The cauldron in the cottage is a 
unique animated object. It attacks any crea -
ture that disturbs Ulizmila’s possessions.

TACTICS
Before Combat Ulizmila’s cauldron appears 
to be a perfectly normal cauldron until the 
objects within the cottage are disturbed, at 
which point it attacks.
During Combat Ulizmila’s cauldron pursues 
would-be thieves to the edge of the clearing 
(it can squeeze through the cottage door). 
If its opponents flee beyond the glade, 
the cauldron returns to its place within 
the cottage and remains inactive until the 
cottage’s contents are again disturbed.
STATISTICS
Abilities Str 12, Dex 10, Con —, Int —, Wis 1,

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Improved Grab (Ex) To use this 
ability, Ulizmila’s cauldron must hit an 
opponent of Medium size or smaller 
with its bite attack. It can then attempt 
to start a grapple as a free action without 
provoking an attack of opportunity. If 
it wins the grapple check, it establishes 
a hold and can attempt to swallow the 
opponent the following round.
Swallow Whole (Ex) When Ulizmila’s 
cauldron begins its turn with a grappled 
opponent in its “mouth,” it can swallow 
that opponent with a successful grapple 
check. Once inside, the opponent 
takes 1d4 points of nonlethal damage 
per round from the cauldron’s wild 
movements. A swallowed creature can 
cut its way out by using a light weapon 
to deal 10 points of damage to the 
cauldron’s interior gizzard (AC 15; 
hardness 5). Once the creature exits, the 
stone of the cauldron reforms, closing 
the hole; another swallowed opponent 
must fight its own way out. Ulizmila’s 
cauldron interior can hold 1 Medium, 2 
Small, 4 Tiny, 8 Diminutive, or 32 Fine or 
smaller opponents.
Hardness (Ex) Ulizmila’s cauldron has hardness 
5 due to its deteriorated condition.
 Treasure:  Due to the volume and dis -
organization of the cottage’s contents, 
it takes 10 minutes and a DC 14 Search 
check to locate the rat’s tail. Those who 
attempt to Search without touching any 
of the shelves’ contents—thus avoiding 
activating the guardian cauldron—can do 
so, but the Search then takes 20 minutes 
to perform. 
 Besides the rat’s tail, there are several 
other items of hidden value in the hut. 
Any character who spends a minute and 
succeeds at a DC 14 Appraise check uncov -
ers statuettes and rare stones worth 30 gp. 
A character who makes a DC 14 Knowl -
edge (arcana) check also uncovers a pouch 
containing essential salts useful in sum -
moning a familiar. If burnt in such a sum -
moning ritual, these minerals decrease 
the rite’s required gp by half. Detect magic  
reveals a few traces of previously pres -
ent magical auras, but the only magic 
item that remains here is a disgusting, 
shrunken head known as a soulspeaker .

9PART 3: THE RUINED 
MONASTERY
After exploring Darkmoon Vale, only one 
ingredient remains to be found: ironbloom 
mushrooms. These small toadstools are 
known to be a dwarven delicacy, and while 
there are no dwarves living in the area, an 
old crumbling dwarven monastery sits at 
the foot of Droskar’s Crag. As such, the PCs’ 
only hope of retrieving these mushrooms is 
to search the ruins on the other side of the 
Darkmoon Vale.
 Unfortunately, predators and worse 
have taken up residence in the ruined 
building. One such beast, a rather old and 
powerful worg named Graypelt, has taken 
over a large portion of the surface ruins 
and finds the mushrooms to be a deli -
cious treat. To save the people of Falcon’s 
Hollow, the PCs must brave the ruins of 
the dwarven monastery and deal with 
Graypelt and his minions.
 Unless otherwise noted, none of the 
chambers inside the monastery are lit. All 
of the rooms have 10-foot-tall ceilings at a 
minimum, but since most open up to the 
sloped roof above, many reach a height of 
up to 20 feet. The walls are all stone, with 
the interior walls being 1 foot thick and 
the exterior walls measuring at least 3 feet 
thick. All of the doors are strong wooden 
doors, and while many are swollen stuck, 
few are locked.
Monastery History
What is not generally known to the peo -
ple of Falcon’s Hollow is that the dwarves 
of this monastery turned to depravity 
and evil long ago. During the fall of their 
people, these recluses turned to the wor -
ship of Droskar, a vile dwarven god of toil. 
Renaming their enclave Droskar’s Crucible, 
the dwarves toiled until their end, leaving 
behind a ruined monastery and a sprawling 
dungeon underneath. Today, little on the 
surface shows any evidence of this vile wor -
ship, as the dwarves kept their true devotion 
a secret.
 This adventure occurs entirely on the 
surface level. The dungeons immedi -
ately below are detailed in D1: Crown of 
the Kobold King . Even more insidiously, 
another foul presence has taken root in 
the deeper d ungeon levels. The source of 
this evil and its greater plans are beyond 
the scope of this adventure. 1. Approaching the Ruins (EL 0 
or 3)
Sitting squat at the foot of an imposing moun -
tain, a ruined monastery comes into view 
between ancient gnarled trees. Made of simple 
stone blocks, worn smooth with the passage 
of time, the stout building is falling apart. Sec -
tions of the slanted shale roof have collapsed 
and portions of the outer wall have crumbled. 
Weeds and wild thorn plants run rampant 
across the field leading up to the place, leaving 
only the slightest indication of a path that ends 
at the ruined front doors. Beyond, an over -
grown yard sits in shadow.
 The old path that leads up to the ruins 
ends about 50 feet from the monastery. 
Before entering the yard, the path passes 
between a pair of old stone statues. While 
one of them is little more than rubble, 
the other is relatively intact. The 5-foot-
tall statue is incredibly worn but it can 
still be made out as a dwarf holding aloft 
a great stone hammer. Moss and creeper 
vines cover most of its surface. Removing 
the vines around the base uncovers an 
old dwarven  inscription that reads “All 
praise, [this part is defaced].” Unfortu -
nately, the missing name was scratched 
off a long time ago and is no longer leg -
ible. A DC 15 Knowledge (history) check 
notes that this statue is from the time of 
the last great dwarven kings, many cen -
turies ago.
 Creatures:  If the PCs approach the 
ruins during the day they find the sur -
rounding area free of hazards. A few lone 
razorcrows roost atop the tower and caw 
at any who enter their domain. At night, 
however, a pair of Graypelt’s wolf min -
ions can be found wandering the area in 
search of an easy snack. These wolves do 
not sleep in the ruins during the day, as 
the other wolves do, and are only encoun -
tered outside at night.
Wolf (2) CR 1
hp 13; MM 283
TACTICS
Before Combat If the wolves spot the PCs 
before combat, they howl loudly as they 
charge, so as to alert Graypelt of the 
intruders.
During Combat The wolves single out one opponent and attempt to set up a flank, both 
using their trip ability as often as possible.
Morale Each wolf flees into the wilderness if 
reduced to fewer than 5 hp.
2. The Yard
Tall grasses and chunks of stone debris have all 
but overtaken this small yard. Off to one side, 
a wooden stable has collapsed into a mound 
of rotting timbers and moldy straw. The outer 
wall on the east side has also collapsed, leaving 
a ragged hole. Three doors exit into this yard—
a pair of double doors to the east, a single door 
to the north, and a lone door leading into the 
squat tower in the southeast corner.
 This yard was once used by the dwarves 
for physical training, but now it lies in 
ruin. Searching the tall grasses reveals 
a few interesting clues. A well hides in 
the northwest corner of the yard, with 10 
feet of rope dangling into it. The water 
is more than 30 feet down and is brack -
ish but potable. Lying next to the well is 
the body of an explorer who came here 
just one year ago. A DC 15 Heal check 
reveals that this explorer was devoured 
by a rather large animal. This explorer fell 
prey to Graypelt’s hunger while trying to 
retrieve some water.
 The ruined stable hides a few ancient 
bones, but little else of value. A DC 10 
Knowledge (nature) check reveals these to 
be the bones of a pony. 
 Although the tall grasses obscure most 
trails, a DC 15 Survival check made by a 
character with the Track feat reveals faint 
signs that some creatures do enter the 
main building through the double doors. 
Some of these tracks look reptilian while 
others are clearly made by four-legged 
mammals. The reptilian trail always leads 
to the main entrance and then out into 
the wild while the mammal tracks leave 
by either the main entrance or through the 
hole in the eastern wall. 
 Treasure: Hiding inside a rotting back -
pack at the base of the well are the remains 
of a week’s worth of trail rations, a set of 
thieves tools, 50 feet of silk rope, a small 
coinpurse with 42 gp in assorted coins, and 
a small blue vial containing a potion of cure 
light wounds . All of this adventurer’s other 
gear was taken long ago.

Hollow’s Last Hope
W
3. Watchtower (EL 1)
The door leading into this tower is stuck 
and requires a DC 13 Strength check to 
open and close. Atop the 30-foot-tall 
tower is an open trapdoor that leads into 
the interior.
Thick webs cover much of the ancient crates 
and barrels stored inside the base of the tower. 
A rickety wooden staircase ascends along one 
wall to reach an open trapdoor above.
 The wooden staircase leading to the 
roof of the tower is not safe. Any Medium 
or larger creature that attempts to climb 
the stairs must make a DC 10 Balance 
skill check. Failing this check means that 
the character cannot ascend. Failing this 
check by 5 or more results in the staircase 
c ollapsing, dealing 2d6 points of damage 
to the unfortunate character. Creatures:  A rather aggressive mon -
strous spider dwells in this room, 
m aking it one of the chambers that 
Graypelt avoids. The moment the door 
opens, the spider drops down to attack. 
Its webs allow it to move throughout the 
tower without using the stairs, but do 
not hinder the PCs movement .
Medium Monstrous Spider CR 1
hp 11; MM 288
TACTICS
Before Combat The spider is hiding in its webs, 
requiring a DC 15 Spot check to notice.
During Combat The spider always attacks the 
nearest foe, without regard to tactics. The 
spider chases PCs outside the tower, but 
not outside the yard.
Morale If in its lair, the spider fights to the 
death. If in the yard, the spider flees back 
into the tower if it takes any amount of 
damage. Treasure:  While the supplies in most 
of the crates and barrels in this room 
have long since rotted away, one small 
crate contains a masterwork shortsword 
wrapped in oilcloth.
4. Entry Hall
Beyond the double doors is a small dark hall. 
Littered with mounds of debris and a year’s 
worth of dead leaves, it is clear that a narrow 
path winds inside.
 Both wolves and kobolds from down 
below occasionally use this chamber to 
enter or exit the monastery. A DC 20 Sur -
vival skill check made by a character with 
the Track feat reveals that most of the traf -
fic through this area heads north. There 
is nothing of interest in the piles of dirt 
and leaves.

5. Waiting Room
The door to this room is stuck and requires 
a DC 13 Strength check to open.
With a loud crack, the door finally gives way 
and opens, shattering an ancient wooden 
chair propped against it on the other side. 
The room beyond is dark and smells deeply of 
dust and decay.
 This chamber was once used as a w aiting 
room for the monastery’s guests. When 
the end finally came for the dwarves, 
one of them went into this chamber and 
imbibed a great deal of poison. His mum -
mified remains rest in the center of the 
chamber. Wearing the garb of a black -
smith, the dwarf has the shattered shards 
of a glass vial in one hand and a scrap of 
ancient parchment in the other. Written 
in dwarven, the parchment reads, “Forgive 
me, dark father of the forge, my toils shall 
never be enough.”
 Treasure:  Tucked into the belt of the 
long-dead dwarf is a silver light hammer 
with a religious symbol carved into the 
head. The symbol can be identified with a 
DC 15 Knowledge (religion) skill check as 
that of Droskar, dwarven god of toil and 
suffering. The hammer is worth 21 gp, but 
to a collector it might be worth as much 
as 200 gp.
6. Cloak Room
This small chamber was used to store the 
traveling cloaks, coats, and hats of visitors to 
the monastery. Now only a few moth-eaten 
rags hang on the pegs and a single soiled 
hat rests on the table. 
 Treasure:  Hiding in the southeast corner 
of the room is a single ironbloom mush -
room. While not enough to save the entire 
town, the lone mushroom is a promising 
start. The mushroom can be found with a 
DC 15 Search check.
7. Guest Quarters (EL 1)
The door leading into this chamber from 
the hallway is locked. The device is quite 
ancient and easy to pick, requiring only a 
DC 20 Open Lock check. 
This small chamber appears to be some sort of 
sitting room, complete with a single table and a 
pair of chairs, both in relatively good c ondition. Resting atop the table is a half-eaten crow next 
to a crude knife and a cracked mug.
 This room is used by Gurtlekep, the 
kobold scout stationed up here on the sur -
face, as a place to rest and take meals. Gur -
tlekep has prepared a relatively simple trap 
for anyone entering his room, as he is quite 
paranoid about the worg and his minions. 
The crow was the kobold’s most recent meal 
and he is quite distressed if anyone disturbs 
his leftovers.
 Trap:  A net strung up near the ceiling 
holds a number of stones and a small metal 
anvil, rigged to fall on anyone w alking 
through the door without noticing the trip 
rope (the door opens out). Each character 
entering the room must make a DC 10 
Reflex save or set off the trap. Those who 
make it do not necessarily notice the trap. 
If set off this trap not only harms intruders, 
but the noise also warns Gurtlekep (area 8) 
of their presence.
Falling Debris Trap CR 1
Type mechanical
Search DC 10; Disable Device DC 15
EFFECTS
Trigger touch; Reset  none
Effect Atk +5 melee (1d6, debris); multiple 
targets (drops 1d4 pieces of debris on each 
target in the room)
8. Gurtlekep’s Room (EL 2)
This small cramped chamber holds two beds 
(one of which is covered in bird bones), a small 
sack, and an array of old tools. The other bed 
looks recently slept in.
 Creature: This chamber is the home of 
Gurtlekep, a kobold scout sent up from 
the dungeon below to keep a lookout on 
the surface. Gurtlekep is here sleeping 
during the day and is usually out roaming 
the halls of the monastery at night. If the 
PCs come here during the day, Gurtlekep 
is unprepared for them unless they set off  
the trap in area 7. If it is night, Gurtlekep 
can be found in area 11, keeping watch on 
the courtyard.

TACTICS
Before Combat If aware of the PCs, 
Gurtlekep hides under the bed, gaining 
total cover. The PCs can make opposed 
Listen checks to hear Gurtlekep before 
he strikes, allowing them to act in the 
surprise round.
During Combat Gurtlekep uses the cramped 
space to his advantage whenever possible, 
preventing others from entering the room. 
He focuses all of his attacks on the PC 
with the least armor first.
Morale If dropped to 3 or fewer hit points, 
Gurtlekep attempts to flee through a hole 
in the wall leading into the hallway. This 
hole is 5 feet above the bed, requiring a 
single DC 10 Climb check to scale. Once 
outside, Gurtlekep attempts to flee to 
warn Greypelt and the kobolds below.

from the altar in area 10.
 Development:  If Gurtlekep is allowed 
to flee, he quickly warns Graypelt of the 
intruders, who dispatches wolves to hunt 
them down. See area 15 for more details.
9: Ruined Library (EL 1)
The double doors leading into this chamber 
are shattered and broken, one of them lying 
on the floor. The room beyond is in an equal 
state of disrepair. What was once a library is 
now a shattered mess with one corner being 
completely collapsed and dominated by a wide 
pool of stagnant water. Thick fungus grows 
on most of the books that still remain on the 
shelves lining the walls.
 This room was once the library of the 
monastery, filled with books on dwarven lore and history. It has long since been 
plundered of nearly anything of value 
and fungus has claimed nearly all the 
books that remain.
 Hazard:  The fungus that lines the 
shelves in this room is hazardous if dis -
turbed. If any of the books are moved 
or destroyed the fungus lets off a puff 
of spores that acts like an inhaled poi -
son affecting everyone within 10 feet 
(inhaled; DC 12; initial 1d2 Con, second -
ary 1d2 Con). In addition, anyone who 
takes damage from the spores has strange 
shadows and flittering movement appear 
in the corners of their vision causing 
them to take a –2 penalty on Spot checks 
for 1 hour.
 Treasure:  Atop one of the bookshelves 
is a single tome that has managed to avoid 
the destructive fungus. This book is written 
in Dwarven and contains hymns to Torag, 
the god venerated here before D roskar. The book is beautifully illuminated and 
is worth 100 gp, but might fetch as much 
as 300 gp if sold to a dwarven collector or 
cleric. Folded into the last page of the book 
is a scroll of spiritual weapon .
10. Desecrated Shrine (EL 3)
Pews of darkwood lie tipped over and covered 
in dust on either side of this ancient shrine. At 
the far end sits a large ceremonial anvil, but 
its surface is defaced and ruined.
 This shrine was once dedicated to 
Torag, the god of the forge, but when the 
monastery turned to Droskar’s worship, 
this chamber was defaced and left to rot. 
The anvil can be identified as an object 
devoted to Torag with a successful DC 10 
Knowledge (religion) check. Of p articular 
note is a space atop the altar containing

Aura Faint abjuration;  CL 3rd
Slot ring; Price 1,200 gp
DESCRIPTION
This simple golden ring has a large red 
gemstone set into it that sparkles with an 
inner fire. The wearer of the ring gains fire 
resistance 10 against the first fire attack that 
hits him that day. This protection renews 
itself every morning at dawn. In addition, 
the wearer receives a +1 resistance bonus on 
saves made against fire spells and effects. 
The ring must be worn for 24 hours to have 
any effect.
CONSTRUCTION
Requirements Forge Ring, resist energy ; Cost 
600 gp, 48 XPRING OF TORAG
13five small depressions. These depres -
sions once held five rubies. While most 
of these stones are long gone, one still 
remains and can be found among the 
other relics in Gurtlekep’s room (area 8). 
If the ruby is placed in one of the depres -
sions, a wave of positive energy washes 
out from the altar, h itting everyone 
in the room and causing an unearthly 
dwarven choir to spring up from the 
darkness before fading away. All crea -
tures in the room receive the benefits 
of a cure light wounds  spell and a gain +1 
morale bonus on attack rolls for 1 hour. 
While this drains the ruby of its magic, 
it still retains its intrinsic value.
 Creatures: A pair of darkmantles has 
taken up residence in this chamber and 
roosts on the ceiling above.  
Darkmantle (2) CR 1
hp 6; MM 38
TACTICS
Before Combat On the round before the 
darkmantles drop down to attack, each 
one casts darkness  on a small stone it 
is holding in one of its tentacles. They 
wait until the entire group is inside the 
chamber before dropping down to strike.
During Combat Each darkmantle targets a 
different foe, attempting to grapple and 
constrict as quickly as possible.
Morale The darkmantles are in their lair and 
fight to the death.
11. Hallway
This long hallway ends with a ruined 
dwarven statue. Smashed long ago, the 
statue is barely recognizable as a dwarven 
monk. His stone hammer sits on the 
ground next to the shattered remains of 
his head.
 Creatures:  If the PCs enter the ruins 
at night, Gurtlekep can be found here 
instead of his room in area 8. From this 
hallway he watches the courtyard for 
any sign of intruders. If he spots the 
PCs entering the monastery he rushes 
to warn Graypelt and his kobold breth -
ren who live below (if you are using this 
adventure as a lead in to D1: Crown of the 
Kobold King ). After raising the alarm, he 
silently stalks the PCs. He waits to strike 
until they are engaged with another foe, 
attacking until slain. See area 8 for Gur -
tlekep’s statistics.12. Infested Ruins (EL 2)
This chamber is entirely shattered, with 
much of the outer wall and ceiling com -
pletely crumbled. 
 This chamber was once a study for the 
monks of the monastery. Today it is only 
home to a swarm of bats that roosts in 
the remnants of the ceiling above. Note 
that most of this room is difficult ter -
rain due to the large chunks of stone and 
debris that litter the floor.
 Creature: The bat swarm that lives in 
this room is relatively harmless unless 
disturbed. If the PCs make any loud noise 
in the chamber (such as disturbing the 
rubble), the swarm descends to attack. 
The swarm can be spotted beforehand 
with a successful DC 15 Spot check.
Bat Swarm  CR 2
hp 13; MM 237
TACTICS
During Combat The bat swarm spreads itself 
out to occupy the space of as many PCs as 
possible each round.
Morale The bat swarm flees from the 
monastery if reduced to fewer than 5 hit 
points. It returns the next dawn to roost in 
the rafters once more.
13. Armory
Old cobweb-covered racks and armor stands 
dominate much of this small chamber. What 
must have once been a well-tended armory 
is now devoid of arms and armor.
 This chamber was pillaged long ago 
by a group of explorers. A secret door 
is located in the northeast corner of the 
room. The secret door can be located 
with a successful DC 20 Search check.
 Treasure:  In their haste, the explorers 
who looted this chamber knocked over 
one of the bolt cases, spilling its contents 
across the floor. They gathered up most 
of the bolts, but 4 of the +1 flaming bolts  
ended up underneath one of the racks 
and were never discovered. The bolts can 
be found with a DC 15 Search check or 
automatically with a detect magic  spell or 
similar effect.14. Secret Prison (EL 1)
The secret door swings open to reveal a short 
corridor with a wall of bars running down one 
side. Four rusted doors open in this wall into 
four cramped cells.
 This chamber was built after the monas -
tery’s conversion to the worship of Droskar. 
It was used to house all of the members who 
did not convert. These unfortunate dwarves 
were left here to die. The locks on the cell 
doors have rusted away, making them easy 
to open.

Hollow’s Last Hope
W
 Creatures:  While all of the cells contain 
the bones of long-dead dwarves, three of 
them are actually skeletons that rise up to 
attack the characters as soon as they open 
any of the cell doors.
Dwarf Warrior Skeletons (3)  CR 1
hp 6; MM 226 (human warrior skeleton)
TACTICS
During Combat The dwarf skeletons move 
to attack the nearest living creature each 
round. They use their claws, as they have no 
scimitars. Note that they are wearing leather 
aprons that grant them a +2 armor bonus 
instead of a shield.
Morale The dwarf skeletons fight to the death.
 Treasure:  The only skeleton here that does 
not animate is from a dwarf that remained 
pious to Torag during his imprisonment. 
His skeleton lies in a peaceful posture on 
his simple straw cot. On one of his hands 
is the ring of Torag , an ancient magic item 
(see sidebar). Growing inside his ribcage is 
a pair of ironbloom mushrooms.
15. Wolf Den (EL 3)
This small study looks like it has been lived 
in recently. Gnawed bones litter the floor and 
tufts of gray fur can be seen here and there. An 
old stone desk sits in the center of the cham -
ber, scratched and cracked in many places. The 
stench of wet fur hangs heavy in the air.
 This was once the study of the high priest, 
where he wrote his upcoming sermons and 
met with foreign visitors. Today, it is the 
den of a pair of female wolves, the consorts 
of Graypelt.
 Creatures: The wolves usually sleep 
behind the desk during the day and 
are active at night. If Graypelt has been 
warned of intruders, these two wolves are 
sent out to find and kill them. In either 
case, the pair attacks the moment they 
spot intruders.
Wolf (2) CR 1
hp 13; MM 283
TACTICS
Before Combat If the wolves spot the PCs 
before combat, they howl loudly as they 
charge, so as to alert Graypelt of the 
intruders.During Combat The wolves single out one 
opponent and attempt to set up a flank, both 
using their trip ability as often as possible.
Morale Each wolf flees to Graypelt’s side if 
reduced to fewer than 5 hp.
 Treasure: The desk is completely empty 
save for a few scraps of ancient parchment 
and an old quill. One of the drawers has a 
secret compartment, though, that can be 
found with a DC 15 Search check. Inside 
is a +1 handaxe, a small pouch containing 
100 pp, and a prayer book. The book is 
written in dwarven and describes the wor -
ship of Droskar. A small note on the inside 
cover reads “Torag is no longer worthy of 
our devotion. Only Droskar can deliver us 
from the failings of King Garbold.” The 
book is worth 50 gp to a scholar interested 
in dwarven history.
16. Graypelt’s Chamber (EL 3)
Gaping holes in the roof allow faint light to 
enter this ruined chamber. One of the stone 
columns that once supported the ceiling is 
toppled, its broken pieces littering the floor. 
A thick patch of black mushrooms hides in a 
nearby corner, giving the room an earthy scent 
that is barely noticeable above the stench of 
wet fur.
 This chamber is the home of Graypelt, 
the sinister worg who sees himself as the 
ruler of the surface ruins. Long before 
Graypelt came to this place, the dwarves 
used this chamber for storage, along with 
the basement below. When the dwarves 
turned to Droskar, the basement below was 
greatly expanded into a dungeon where the 
dwarves worshiped in secret. This dungeon 
is described in D1: Crown of the Kobold King . 
If you are using this adventure alone, the 
mushrooms are the sole reason the PCs 
have for coming here and the basement 
below is just a small empty chamber, save 
for cobwebs and dust.
 Creatures:  Graypelt is a cunning foe 
and recognizes the PCs for a serious threat 
the moment they enter. With his consorts 
wounded or dead, he is cautious in dealing 
with the intruders. His first act is to spring 
up from out of hiding atop the ruined 
column, baring his teeth and making an 
Intimidate check to demoralize them. If the PCs move to attack, he speaks, demanding 
to know why they have disturbed his rest. If 
they tell him of their need, he lies to them 
and tells them he is willing to let them take 
the mushrooms (or let them go below if 
this module is being used as a prelude) if 
they assist him in ridding the monastery 
of some of the other monsters. Graypelt 
knows of all the creatures in the monastery 
except for the skeletons in area 14 and asks 
the PCs to slay the darkmantles. When they 
return from this task, he asks them to slay 
the bat swarm and then the spider in the 
tower. The worg hopes that by getting the 
PCs to fight these other monsters he can 
weaken them so he can easily defeat them 
when they finally return. 
 Regardless of whether or not the PCs 
accept Graypelt’s quest, he has no intention 
of allowing them to take his prized mush -
rooms and attacks the moment their guard 
is down.

when he attacks them.
During Combat Graypelt singles out the 
weak in any combat situation, targeting 
spellcasters first. He uses Power Attack 
when attacking such foes but never for 
more than 3 points. He does not attack 
prone foes unless he has no other choice or 
they try to stand.
Morale This is Graypelt’s home and he fights to 
the death to protect it.

CONCLUSION
After retrieving all the ingredients needed, 
the PCs can rush back to Falcon’s Hollow 
without much delay. Laurel is glad to see 
them and immediately sets out to brew the

APPENDIX
This module presents a brand new monster, 
the tatzlwyrm, a smaller wingless cousin of 
true dragons.
Tatzlwyrm
Slithering like a large snake, this creature has the 
head of a dragon and a pair of clawed arms to 
help it move along and grasp prey. A sickly green

SPECIAL ABILITIES
Improved Grab (Ex) To use this ability, a 
tatzlwyrm must hit a Medium or smaller 
foe with its bite attack. It can then attempt 
to start a grapple as a free action without 
provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins 
the grapple check, it establishes a hold. 
Poison Gasp (Ex) A tatzlwyrm’s breath is 
poisonous, but not very powerful. While 
grappling, instead of making a bite or 
rake attack, a tatzlwyrm can breathe its 
poison into its victim’s face (contact; 
DC 12; initial 1 Con; secondary —; note 
that the initial damage is equal to the 
tatzlwyrm’s Con modifier). The save DC is 
Constitution-based.

THE TATZLWYRM
A creature of Austrian, Bavarian, and 
Swiss descent—related to the German 
lindwurm  or Scandinavian  linnorm —real-
world Alpine legends describe the tatzlw -
yrm (“clawed worm” in German) as a giant 
salamander lacking rear legs and some -
times exhibiting a feline head. Widely 
believed in throughout the Middle Ages 
due to the proliferation of corroborating 
descriptions and, later, artistic depictions 
(though the verbal and illustrated reports 
hold little in common), even Marco Polo 
described the beast in the account of his 
travels, Il Milione . Although far less com -
mon than centuries ago, sightings of tat -
zlwyrms are still reported today.

A whelp race of dragonkind, tatzlwyrms 
lurk amid the deepest wilds of the natu -
ral world. Although they lack many of the 
qualities of true dragons—most notably 
wings and powerful breath weapons—their 
instinctual cunning and innate ferocity 
is not diminished by their size. Feral yet 
patient hunters, tatzlwyrms spend most of 
their time lying in wait for prey, u ncaring 
of whether it takes the form of deer, wolves, 
or men.
 Possessing the same hoarding compul -
sion as their better-known draconic cous -
ins, tatzlywryms collect the remains of their 
hunts, the eldest accumulating morbid 
troves of bones and debris. Incidentally, 
heavily gnawed equipment and forgotten 
treasures often lie littered among these 
grim hoards, even although the dragonkin 
have no use for such wealth.
 Innately stealthy and uncomfortable in 
open areas, tatzlwyrms are rarely seen, and 
in many regions are thought to be little 
more than local legends. As such, folkloric 
rumors persist of their weird abilities and OPEN GAME LICENSE Version 1.0a
